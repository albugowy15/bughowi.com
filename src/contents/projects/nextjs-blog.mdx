## Description

Create a simple blog with Next.js and Tailwind. I learn how to implement some core features of Next.js likes Static Site Genereation and Server Side Rendering. And for the blog posts, I use Conten Management Service (CMS) called Hygraph. Hygraph is a GraphQL native Headless CMS. Hygraph allows us to create schema and fill this schema with content (text, image, video, url, file).
