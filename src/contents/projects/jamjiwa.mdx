## Description

Some cities in East Java have a bit different characteristics when it comes to using the Javanese language in daily life. These five areas are Surabaya, Madiun, Malang, Banyuwangi, and Madura. Jamjiwa is possible to translate the Javanese language from one area to another, for example, from Surabaya to Malang, or from Banyuwangi to Malang. Additionally, it is possible to translate the Javanese language used in all five areas into Indonesian (bahasa).
