# About Me

## Introduction

Hello! I'm <span className="font-bold text-yellowAccent">Owi</span>. I'm a Computer Science student - Fullstack Developer from Jepara, Indonesia. I have been learning some basic of Web Programming since high school by creating a blog using CMS likes Wordpress and Blogger. But I didn't create it myself. Instead I was just download some free Wordpress or Blogger template on the internet then I modified it a little bit.

I started digging more about Web Development stuff during my college. Start by learn Javascript and PHP, then continue using some popular framework such as React.js, Next.js and Laravel. As I delved deeper into the world of web development, I discovered TypeScript and was immediately drawn to its strong typing and improved code scalability. I decided to make the switch and have been loving the enhanced development experience that TypeScript provides. It has not only helped me write more robust and maintainable code, but it has also allowed me to take on more complex projects with confidence. I'm excited to continue exploring the capabilities of TypeScript and using it to build even more powerful web applications.

I've created this blog for two main reasons. First, as a developer, I am constantly learning new skills and technologies. I wanted a place to document and reflect on what I've learned inorder to solidify my understanding and be able to refer back to it later. Second, I wanted to showcase my projects and share my experiences with others in the developer community. I believe that sharing knowledge and helping others is an important part of being a developer. I hope that my blog will be a useful resource for other developers, and that it will help me to continue growing as a developer.

## Tech Stack

I'm currently enjoy build website using TypeScript, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS.

### TypeScript

I have found that using TypeScript as my current tech stack is the perfect choice for me. TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing, classes, and interfaces. It provides many features that help me to catch errors early in the development process, making my code more reliable. TypeScript also enables me to write object-oriented code, and it's easy to refactor and scale. The type checking and autocompletion features that TypeScript provides, make my development process faster and more efficient. I'm excited to continue working with TypeScript and using it to build more powerful and scalable applications.

### Next.js

Next.js is a framework built on top of React that makes it easy to create server-rendered React applications. The framework provides a lot of out-of-the-box features that make development much faster and easier. It also enables me to build applications that are SEO friendly and have a better performance. With the help of Next.js, I have been able to build highly dynamic and responsive web applications that are optimized for both the user and the developer. I'm excited to continue exploring the capabilities of Next.js and using it to build even more powerful web applications.

### Tailwind

I have found that using a utility-first CSS framework like Tailwind CSS can help me to create fast, responsive, and beautiful web pages. Tailwind CSS provides a wide range of pre-defined CSS classes that can be used to quickly style elements on a page. This makes it easy to create consistent and responsive designs that look great on any device. I also appreciate the flexibility and customization options that Tailwind CSS provides. I can easily customize the design to match the look and feel of any project. I'm excited to continue working with Tailwind CSS and using it to create beautiful and functional web pages.
