# About Me

## Introduction

Hello! I'm <span className="font-bold text-yellowAccent">Owi</span>. I'm a Computer Science student - Software Engineer from Jepara, Indonesia. I've established this blog with two primary objectives. Firstly, as a developer, I'm in a perpetual state of acquiring new skills and exploring emerging technologies. I sought to create a space where I can meticulously document and reflect upon my learning journey, thus reinforcing my comprehension and establishing a reference for future use. Secondly, I aimed to showcase my projects and share my experiences with fellow members of the developer community. I firmly believe that the act of sharing knowledge and aiding others is integral to the role of a developer. My aspiration is for this blog to serve as a valuable resource for fellow developers, facilitating mutual growth within the community and contributing to my continuous development as a skilled professional.

## Programming Languages

Currently, I am focused on learning and implementing **TypeScript**, **Go**, and **Rust** as the primary programming languages in my projects. I believe that proficiency in these three languages can significantly enhance the value in software development.

TypeScript offers advantages in terms of static typing, which can improve code security and quality. Meanwhile, Go, with its concurrency concepts and high performance, is well-suited for large-scale projects. Rust, on the other hand, provides high-level security without compromising performance, making it valuable for the development of critical systems.

Through this blog, I hope to share a profound understanding of the usage of these three languages, as well as the experiences and challenges that arise in their implementation. By sharing this knowledge, my aim is to make a positive contribution to the developer community and facilitate the exchange of valuable information for fellow developers in Indonesia and around the world.

## Favorite Frameworks and Libraries

Discovering the utility of frameworks has significantly accelerated my application development process, enhancing both speed and efficiency. These frameworks not only facilitate swift development but also contribute to the creation of more secure and scalable applications. I am enthusiastic about further delving into the capabilities of these frameworks and harnessing them to construct even more robust applications.

### Next.js

Next.js stands out as a preferred framework, offering advanced features and a seamless development experience. Its capabilities in server-side rendering and routing make it a valuable asset in creating dynamic and performant web applications.

### Tailwind

Embracing Tailwind has proven instrumental in streamlining my styling process. The utility-first approach of Tailwind enables rapid and consistent styling, empowering me to create visually appealing and responsive user interfaces efficiently.

### Astro

Exploring the innovative features of Astro has been an exciting journey. Its focus on performance and the ability to seamlessly blend static and dynamic content make it a promising framework for building modern, high-performance websites. I look forward to utilizing Astro's capabilities for future projects and expanding my expertise in web development.

There are also other frameworks and libraries that I have used in my projects, such as Prisma, tRPC, Tokio, Gin, and Axum. I am excited to continue exploring the capabilities of these frameworks and libraries and using them to build even more powerful applications.
