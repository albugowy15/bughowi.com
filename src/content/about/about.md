# About Me

Hey there! üëã I'm Mohamad Kholid Bughowi, a passionate software engineer with a knack for turning complex problems into elegant solutions. I believe in the power of technology to create meaningful impact, and I'm constantly exploring new ways to push the boundaries of what's possible in software development.

## My Journey

My path in technology began at [Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember (ITS)](https://www.its.ac.id/), where I earned my Bachelor's degree in Informatics. But my real education never stops - I'm a firm believer in continuous learning and staying ahead of the technology curve. From my early days coding simple applications to now architecting complex systems, every challenge has been a stepping stone to growth.

## What I Do

I specialize in full-stack development with a particular focus on creating scalable, maintainable applications. My approach combines technical expertise with a deep understanding of user needs, ensuring that every solution I build not only works flawlessly but also delivers real value.

### Technical Philosophy

My tech stack choices are driven by three core principles:

- **Type Safety**: TypeScript is my go-to language for web development, as I believe strong typing leads to more reliable and maintainable code
- **Performance**: Go has become my trusted companion for building efficient backend services that can scale
- **System Reliability**: Rust represents my commitment to writing secure, high-performance systems when requirements demand it

## Professional Journey

Currently, I'm working as a **Frontend Developer** at [Astra International](https://www.astra.co.id/), where I'm contributing to projects that push the boundaries of what's possible in web development. My career path has been marked by diverse experiences across different domains:

### Industry Experience Highlights

- **Social Media Integration**: At [Teepee](https://www.teepee.app/), I led the migration of backend services from Strapi to Go, significantly improving system performance and user experience in a creator-business connection platform
- **Healthcare Technology**: During my time at [Hash](https://www.hash.id/), I contributed to modernizing healthcare information systems using TypeScript and GraphQL
- **Government Digital Transformation**: At [Dinkominfo Surabaya](https://dinkominfo.surabaya.go.id/), I played a key role in developing an API Gateway that unified digital services across the city
- **EdTech Innovation**: My work at [Torche Education](https://torche.app/) involved revamping their digital presence and modernizing their tech stack

## Beyond the Code

While coding is my profession, my passion extends beyond just writing code. I'm deeply interested in:

- **Software Architecture**: Designing systems that are not just functional, but sustainable and scalable
- **Developer Experience**: Creating tools and processes that make development more efficient and enjoyable
- **Open Source**: Contributing to and learning from the open source community
- **Tech Community**: Sharing knowledge and experiences with fellow developers
