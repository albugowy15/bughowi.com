## Description

Filinmovie is a Transactional Video On Demand (TVOD) application that connects creative content creators with film enthusiasts wherever they are. It aims to provide an easy, secure, and comfortable movie-watching experience. Filinmovie is a platform that allows users to rent or buy movies and watch them on their devices.

As a Frontend Developer at Filin, I collaborate with different teams to make sure our app's frontend is easy to use, fast, and looks great. I work closely with the design team to ensure the app's theme and appearance are consistent, and with the backend development team to ensure the frontend and backend work together seamlessly. Additionally, I communicate with the project owner or stakeholder to get a better understanding of their goals for the app, which helps me to create a frontend that meets their needs.
