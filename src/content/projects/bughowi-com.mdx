## Description

My personal blog that contains article about Web Development and programming in general. In this blog I try to implement some of my skills in Web Development likes Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, MDX, and Contentlayer.

## Repository

## Tech Stack

### TypeScript

A strongly typed language that makes writing JavaScript safer. This is my first project built with TypeScript, and it really saves me from getting bugs when trying to get posts and project data. I have created a post about TypeScript basic concepts if you want to learn more about TypeScript fundamentals.

### Next.js

The file system routing and SSG features are really helpful for creating a static blog.

### Tailwind

The tailwind docs are its real magic. It is actually better documented than CSS itself. It's such a pleasure to use.

### MDX

MDX allows me to use JSX in my markdown content. I can import components, such as interactive charts or alerts, and embed them within my content. This makes writing long-form content with components a blast.

### Contentlayer

Because my post and projects is written in **MDX** files, so Contentlayer gives me a nice abstraction between my MDX files and my application. I can define document type for post and project, then get all posts and projects using `getStaticProps()` and display it using `useMDXComponent` that `next-contentlayer` provided.

## Deployment

I deploy this project in Vercel. You can check it here : [https://bughowi.com](https://bughowi.com)
