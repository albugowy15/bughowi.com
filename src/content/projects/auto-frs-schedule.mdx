## Description

This project is a part of the [Informatics FRS Helper](https://github.com/albugowy15/informatics-frs-helper) project to automatically parse all class schedule from Excel files to MySQL database.

## Features

- Parse and get specific data from Excel file
- Write the result to sql file
- Insert the result to MySQL database
- Loading bar when inserting to database

Below I have listed some of the supported arguments :

- `-p --push` : Optional arg to determine wether only to parse excel or also push class to DB
- `-f --file` : Required arg for path to excel file
- `-s --sheet` : Required arg for excel sheet name
- `-o --outdir` : Optional arg to write the sql statement to output directory

## Tech Stack

### Rust

Rust is a modern programming language that is known for its memory safety, concurrency support, and efficient performance. It is a good choice for building CLI applications because it can be used to create reliable and fast command-line tools.

### Clap

Clap is a command-line argument parser for Rust. It makes it easy to define and parse command-line inputs, which is essential for any CLI application.

### Calamine

Calamine is an Excel parsing library for Rust. It allows you to read and write Excel files, which is useful for applications that need to interact with Excel data.

### Tokio 

Tokio is a runtime for asynchronous Rust applications. It provides a way to manage tasks and concurrency, which is essential for building scalable and efficient CLI applications.

### Sqlx

Sqlx is a Rust library for interacting with databases. It makes it easy to perform SQL queries, which is useful for applications that need to store and retrieve data from a database.
