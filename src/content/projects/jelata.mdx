## Tech Stack

### JavaScript

Using JavaScript to create a 3D object and render it on the canvas element. It also helpful manipulate the DOM element to response user interaction.

### Three.js

Three.js is a cross-browser JavaScript library and application programming interface used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser using WebGL. It is the most popular 3D library for the web.

### WebGL

WebGL is a JavaScript API for rendering interactive 3D and 2D graphics within any compatible web browser without the use of plug-ins. WebGL does so by introducing an API that closely conforms to OpenGL ES 2.0 that can be used in HTML5 `<canvas>` elements.

### Webpack

Webpack is a static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications. When webpack processes your application, it internally builds a dependency graph which maps every module your project needs and generates one or more bundles.
