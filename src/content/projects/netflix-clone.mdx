## Description

I try to clone Netflix website, but not all it's features. I build Netflix Homepage and get the movie data from [TMDB API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/). I also add simple authentication feature, so you can create account login with email and password. I use Firebase to deal with authentication and save some user data with Firestore.
