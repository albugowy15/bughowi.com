## Introduction

The [Informatics FRS Helper](https://tc-frs-helper.live) Public API is a robust RESTful service designed to facilitate access to detailed information regarding courses, lecturers, and classes. Leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as Rust, Axum, SQLx, and Tokio, the API ensures a balance of performance and safety.

## Endpoints

The API offers various endpoints for accessing specific data:

- **Courses Endpoint (/v1/matkul)**: Retrieve comprehensive information about courses.
- **Lecturers Endpoint (/v1/dosen)**: Access details about lecturers.
- **Classes Endpoint (/v1/kelas)**: Obtain information related to classes.

## Documentation

For a comprehensive understanding of the API and its usage, please refer to the [Postman Documentation](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/30505077/2s9YsJBCJo). Utilize the Postman collection provided to seamlessly interact with the API endpoints. Postman offers a user-friendly environment for testing and exploring the functionality of the API.

## Deployment

The API is efficiently deployed on Fly.io using a Docker container. Access the API through the following deployment URL: [https://api-informatics-frs-helper.fly.dev](https://api-informatics-frs-helper.fly.dev)

## Tech Stacks

### Rust

Rust is a multi-paradigm programming language designed for performance and safety, especially safe concurrency. Rust is syntactically similar to C++, but its designers intend it to provide better memory safety while maintaining high performance.

### Axum

Axum is a web application framework that focuses on ergonomics and modularity. It's built on Tokio and Hyper, and it provides everything you need to build robust and efficient web applications with Rust.

### SQLx

SQLx is an async, pure Rust SQL crate featuring compile-time checked queries without a DSL. It enables you to interact with databases directly in Rust, ensuring type safety and connection handling.

### Tokio

Tokio is a Rust framework for developing applications which perform asynchronous I/O â€” an event-driven approach that can often achieve better performance, lower latency, and greater resource utilization than conventional synchronous I/O.
